Hub
================
The field :code:`hub` describes the hub system from an aeroelastic perspective, distinguishing between aerodynamic and elastic properties, added in the fields :code:`outer_shape_bem` and :code:`elastic_properties_mb` respectively.

.. literalinclude:: ../../test/turbine_example.yaml
    :start-after: # Hub
    :end-before: # Nacelle

:code:`diameter` : Float, m
    This is the outer diameter of the hub. It is also the diameter of the circle centered at the rotor apex and connecting the blade root centers.

:code:`cone_angle` : Float, rad
    This is the precone of the rotor. It is defined positive for standard upwind and downwind rotors.

:code:`drag_coefficient` : Float
    This is the equivalent drag coefficient used to compute the aerodynamic forces generated by the hub immersed in the flow. Standard aeroelastic solvers use this parameter.

:code:`system_mass` : Float, kg
    This is the overall mass of the hub system, which includes the hub itself, but also the spinner, the pitch system, the blade root bearings, and auxiliary equipment.

:code:`system_inertia` : Array (6) of floats, kg*m2
    Mass moments of inertia of the hub system. Ixx, Iyy, Izz, Ixy, Ixz, Iyz are expressed around the hub center in hub-aligned coordinate system, which has x aligned with the main shaft pointing from the rotor apex towards the nacelle. Iyy and Izz are usually identical.

:code:`system_center_mass` : Array (3) of floats, m
    Coordinates of the center of mass of the hub. Work in progress.


Nacelle
====================

The field :code:`nacelle` describes the nacelle system from an aeroelastic perspective, distinguishing between aerodynamic and elastic properties, added in the fields :code:`outer_shape_bem` and :code:`elastic_properties_mb` respectively. An addition field :code:`drivetrain` is optional and defines some of the inputs used to size the drivetrain components.

.. literalinclude:: ../../test/turbine_example.yaml
    :start-after: # Nacelle
    :end-before: # end nacelle

:code:`uptilt_angle` : Float, rad
    Angle between the main shaft and the horizontal plane. This is defined positive for standard upwind and downwind turbines.

:code:`distance_tt_hub` : Float, m
    Vertical distance between the top of the tower and the hub center.

:code:`overhang` : Float, m
    Horizontal distance between the axis of the tower and the hub center.

:code:`length` : Float, m
    Length of the nacelle, defined along the main shaft.

:code:`height` : Float, m
    Height of the nacelle, defined along the direction perpendicular to the main shaft.

:code:`width` : Float, m
    Width of the nacelle, defined horizontal and perpendicular to the main shaft.

:code:`drag_coefficient` : Float
    This is the equivalent drag coefficient used to compute the aerodynamic forces generated by the nacelle immersed in the flow. Standard aeroelastic solvers use this parameter.

:code:`above_yaw_mass` : Float, kg
    This is the overall mass of the nacelle system, which includes the main shaft, the drivetrain system, the generator, the nacelle cover, etc. This does not include the yaw system.

:code:`yaw_mass` : Float, kg
    Mass of the yaw system.

:code:`center_mass` : Float, m
    These are the coordinates of the center of mass of the nacelle, defined in yaw-aligned coordinate system, which has x horizontal pointing downwind, y horizontal pointing laterally, and z pointing vertically upwards.

:code:`inertia` : Array (6) of floats, kg*m2
    Mass moments of inertia of the nacelle system. Ixx, Iyy, Izz, Ixy, Ixz, Iyz are expressed in the yaw-aligned coordinate system.
